How to proceed

To make instant jalebi, sieve the flour with baking powder and keep aside
.
Combine the curds with 1/3 cup of water in a bowl and whisk well.Add the flour and make a thick batter, making sure that no lumps remain. Keep aside.
Heat the ghee in a broad saucepan (the pan should be approximately 25 mm. (1") deep).
Fill the jalebi batter into a piping bag with a single hole nozzle. Alternatively, use a plastic bottle with a small hole in the lid to fill the batter.
Press out round whirls of the batter into the hot ghee working closely from outside to the centre of the whirl [approximately 50 mm. (2") diameter].
Deep-fry the jalebis till golden brown from both the sides and transfer immediately into the warm sugar syrup.
Drain after 2 to 3 minutes and serve the instant jalebis hot sprinkled with cardamom powder.
